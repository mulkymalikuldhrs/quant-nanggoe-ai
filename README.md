## 🌌 The Ecosystem

Quant Nanggroe AI is a **Living Operating System** designed for high-frequency quantitative analysis and autonomous research. It transcends traditional chatbots by offering a fully functional desktop environment (`Nanggroe OS`) where the AI Agent acts as an operator, not just a responder.

### 🔥 100x Upgrade Features (v5.0)

1.  **Neural Shell (CLI)**
    *   A fully functional Debian-like terminal (`root@nanggroe:~$`).
    *   File System manipulation (`ls`, `cat`, `mkdir`) directly on the Virtual Drive.
    *   Hybrid Intelligence: Pipe natural language commands directly to the Swarm.

2.  **Neural Browser (Agent Vision)**
    *   **Active Reading:** The Agent can navigate to URLs and *read* the content via a Neural Proxy engine, bypassing iframe restrictions.
    *   **Motor Cortex:** The Agent can issue `NAVIGATE_BROWSER` commands to surf the web autonomously.
    *   **Dual Mode:** Supports "Reader Mode" for text extraction and "Direct Mode" for apps like **TradingView** and **MetaTrader 5**.

3.  **Real-World Integration**
    *   **No Simulation:** All market data is fetched real-time from CoinGecko, DexScreener, and AlphaVantage.
    *   **Professional Tools:** Built-in MT5 Web Terminal and TradingView Advanced Charts.

## 🚀 Key Modules

*   **Alpha Prime:** The Orchestrator Agent using `gemini-3-pro` or `llm7`.
*   **Quant OS:** The Technical Analyst using deterministic math (RSI, MACD, Bollinger).
*   **BrowserFS:** A persistent virtual file system stored in your browser.
*   **ML Engine:** An auto-evolving weighting system that learns from trade history.
