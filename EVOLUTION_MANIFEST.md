*   **Aesthetics:** Implemented macOS White Sur design language with Glassmorphism and Dual-Mode (Day/Night).
*   **Resilience:** Integrated robust multi-proxy market data pipelines.

### Phase 7: The Sequoia Glass Era (v11.0.x - Sequoia Glass)
*   **Visual Overhaul:** Complete migration to **macOS Sequoia** aesthetics with "Sequoia Glass" effects (50px+ blur).
*   **Feature Integration ("Better Features"):**
    *   **AutoSwitch API Engine**: Failover otonom untuk ketersediaan sistem 99.9%.

### Phase 8: The Diamond Glass Era (v11.1.0)
*   **Diamond Visuals**: Upgraded "Sequoia Glass" to "Diamond Glass" with micro-diamond textures and enhanced transparency.
*   **Global Health Monitor**: Implementation of a centralized API health tracking system within AutoSwitch v2.

### Phase 9: The Sapphire Glass Era (v11.2.0)
*   **Sapphire Glass Visuals**: Introduced "Sapphire Glass" aesthetics with deep-blue crystalline tints and enhanced micro-shadows.
*   **Sapphire Latency Optimizer**: Deployment of an adaptive state synchronization layer for near-zero UI delay during high-frequency swarm operations.

### Phase 10: The Knowledge Disk Era (v11.3.0 - CURRENT)
*   **Autonomous Research Agent**: Implementation of an automated intelligence gathering agent that scans public APIs otonomously.
*   **Knowledge Disk (C:)**: Introduction of a structured virtual file system for long-term intelligence storage and organization.
*   **Disk Explorer UI**: Deployment of a professional file explorer for navigating the internal knowledge base.
