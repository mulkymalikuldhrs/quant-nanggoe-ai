## 📜 Development History (Conversation Log Summary)

### Phase 1 - 5: Legacy Evolution (v1.0 - v9.0)
*   Development of the core React framework, Swarm Intelligence, and early HUD monitoring systems.

### Phase 6: The OS Revolution (v10.0 - White Sur Edition)
*   **UI Revolution:** Shifted from a web-page layout to a **Desktop OS Environment**.
*   **Aesthetics:** Implemented macOS White Sur design language with Glassmorphism and Dual-Mode (Day/Night).
*   **Resilience:** Integrated robust multi-proxy market data pipelines.

### Phase 7: The Sequoia Glass Era (v11.0.x - Sequoia Glass)
*   **Visual Overhaul:** Complete migration to **macOS Sequoia** aesthetics with "Sequoia Glass" effects (50px+ blur).
*   **Feature Integration ("Better Features"):**
    *   **AutoSwitch API Engine**: Failover otonom untuk ketersediaan sistem 99.9%.

### Phase 8: The Diamond Glass Era (v11.1.0)
*   **Diamond Visuals**: Upgraded "Sequoia Glass" to "Diamond Glass" with micro-diamond textures and enhanced transparency.
*   **Global Health Monitor**: Implementation of a centralized API health tracking system within AutoSwitch v2.

### Phase 9: The Sapphire Glass Era (v11.2.0)
*   **Sapphire Glass Visuals**: Introduced "Sapphire Glass" aesthetics with deep-blue crystalline tints and enhanced micro-shadows.
*   **Sapphire Latency Optimizer**: Deployment of an adaptive state synchronization layer for near-zero UI delay during high-frequency swarm operations.

### Phase 10: The Knowledge Disk Era (v11.3.0)
*   **Autonomous Research Agent**: Implementation of an automated intelligence gathering agent that scans public APIs otonomously.
*   **Knowledge Disk (C:)**: Introduction of a structured virtual file system for long-term intelligence storage and organization.

### Phase 11: The Autonomous Intelligence Core (v11.4.0)
*   **Hyper-Autonomous Intelligence**: Upgraded Research Agent with advanced cross-sector logic (Institutional, Sentiment, Geo, AI).
*   **Deep Memory Sync**: Synchronized the Virtual Disk C: with the swarm's neural memory for real-time alpha generation.

### Phase 12: The Quantum Nexus Era (v11.5.0 - CURRENT)
*   **Quantum Nexus Engine**: Implementation of a probabilistic quantum state modeling engine for market forecasting.
*   **Nexus Command Center**: A unified high-density "War Room" interface aggregating all intelligence streams into a single window.
*   **Synaptic Signal Logs**: Visual representation of active neural processing nodes within the autonomous research system.
*   **System-Wide v11.5.0 Sync**: Harmonized all core services, metadata, and UI with the Quantum Nexus architecture.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

1.  **AI Screen Perception**: Allow the swarm to "see" and interact with the UI visually using Screen Share API.
2.  **Voice Synthesis 2.0**: Neural voice integration for real-time market briefings.
3.  **DEX Execution Engine**: Autonomous on-chain trading capabilities via smart contracts.
