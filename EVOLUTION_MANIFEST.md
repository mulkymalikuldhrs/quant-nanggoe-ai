## 📜 Development History (Conversation Log Summary)

This manifest documents the journey of the Quant Nanggroe AI ecosystem, reflecting the prompts and architectural shifts that occurred during development.

### Phase 1: The Genesis
*   **Initial Concept:** Creation of a React-based interface using Google GenAI.
*   **Core Requirement:** Avoid simulation; seek "Reality". Use real API calls, real state management.
*   **Identity:** Established the name "Quant Nanggroe AI" and the concept of a "Super Orchestrator".

### Phase 2: Swarm Intelligence
*   **Agent Expansion:** Moved from a single bot to a **Multi-Agent Swarm**.
*   **Roles Defined:**
    *   *The Architect* (Orchestration)
    *   *Code Weaver* (Development)
    *   *Researcher* (Grounding)
*   **Visualization:** Implemented the `SwarmGraph` to visualize nodes and data packets in real-time.

### Phase 3: The Hybrid Core & Router
*   **Infrastructure Upgrade:** Implemented `LLMRouter`.
*   **Model Integration:**
    *   Primary: `LLM7` (gpt-4.1-nano) for speed and cost-efficiency.
    *   Failovers: Google Gemini & Groq.
*   **Resilience:** Added Self-Healing protocols to handle API failures automatically.

### Phase 4: Self-Evolution (The Patch System)
*   **Capability Upgrade:** Agents were granted the ability to write code patches.
*   **Tooling:** Added simulated `codeExecution` and `systemUpgrade` tools.
*   **HUD Update:** Added "Patches" tab to visualize proposed system upgrades.

### Phase 5: The Operating System (Current State)
*   **UI Revolution:** Shifted from a web-page layout to a **Desktop OS Environment**.
*   **Features:**
    *   Window Management (Drag, Resize, Minimize).
    *   Taskbar & System Tray.
    *   Neural Terminal (Chat).
    *   Swarm Monitor (HUD).
*   **Audit Protocol:** Implemented immutable audit logging for all system events.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

1.  **File System Persistence:** Integrate actual BrowserFS to save files across sessions.
2.  **Voice Synthesis:** Add WebSpeech API for the Avatar to speak via audio.
3.  **Vision Upgrade:** Allow the Swarm to "see" the user's screen (Screen Share API).
